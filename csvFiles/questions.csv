The firm has a market value of EUR100.0 million and a corporate tax rate of 20%. Plover plans to issue EUR35.0 million in debt to retire an equivalent amount of equity, so the size of the firm will remain unchanged. The debt will have a cost of 4.5%. Assume the cost of financial distress is close to zero.

After the debt issuance and change in the capital structure, Plover’s WACC is closest to:",5.47%,7.48%,8.82%,B,"B is correct. The calculations to determine the WACC are as follows:

The after-tax cash flows for the company are EUR10.0 million (1 – 0.20) = EUR8.0 million. Since the cash flows are assumed to be perpetual, WACC for the unlevered firm is calculated as

rWACC = CF(1 – t)/V = EUR8.0 million/EUR100.0 million = 8.0%.

The market value of Plover with the debt financing is EUR107 million:

VL = VU + tD = EUR100.0 million + 0.20(EUR35.0 million) = EUR107.0 million.

To find the cost of equity, we first need to find the market value of equity:

VL = D + E, where D and E are market values of debt and equity, respectively.

E = EUR107.0 million – EUR35.0 million = EUR72.0 million.

The cost of equity is given by

𝑟𝑒=𝑟0+(𝑟0−𝑟𝑑)(1−𝑡)𝐷/𝐸
= 8.0% + (8.0% – 4.5%)(0.80)(EUR35.0 million/EUR72.0 million) = 9.36%.

Plover’s WACC is calculated as follows:

WACC = (Weighting of debt × Cost of debt) + (Weighting of equity × Cost of equity)
= (EUR35 million/EUR107.0 million)(4.5%)(1 – 0.2) + (EUR72.0 million/EUR107.0 million)(9.36%)

Private equity funds typically calculate their management fee based on committed capital, which is the total amount that the limited partners have promised to fund future investments, rather than based on assets under management. The committed-capital basis for management fees is an important distinction from hedge funds, whose management fees are typically based on assets under management. Having committed capital as the basis for management fee calculations reduces the incentive for GPs to deploy the committed capital as quickly as possible to grow their fee base and thus allows the GPs to be selective about deploying capital into investment opportunities. B is incorrect because alternative investment funds usually combine a management fee with a performance fee paid when fund returns exceed a specified hurdle rate.

The total fee earned by Rotunda in the current year is closest to:",$7.2 M,$20.16 M,$21.60 M,A,"A is correct. Although the gross return of Rotunda results in a $360 million gross NAV, the deduction of the $7.2 million management fee brings NAV to $352.8 million, which is below the prior high-water mark. Rotunda earns a management fee of $7.20 million but does not earn an incentive fee because the year-end fund value net of management fee does not exceed the prior high-water mark of $357 million. Since Rotunda is still also below the prior-year high-water mark, the hurdle rate of return is also basically irrelevant in this fee calculation. 

The specifics of this calculation are as follows: 

End-of-year AUM = Prior year-end AUM × (1 + Fund return) = $288 million × 1.25 = $360 million. 

$360 million × 2% = $7.20 million management fee.

Private capital can have overall positive contributions to diversification. Note, however, that direct lending can involve a large capital commitment to a single borrower, with increased concentration risk and reduced diversification.

Master limited partnerships trade on exchanges, are pass-through entities like REITs, and may also share with REITs taxation rules that minimize double taxation for investors. 
Investors concerned about liquidity and diversification may choose publicly traded infrastructure securities. 
Because of the concentration and liquidity risks and the typical long-term horizon, direct infrastructure investment usually takes place with a group or consortium of strategic investors that share the financial risk and/or assume a specific role in building, operating, or managing the assets.

Brownfield assets with mitigated risks (e.g., fully constructed with contracted/regulated revenues) that are located in the most stable OECD countries have a high weighting to current yield. Greenfield assets with limited construction and demand risk have a mix of yield and capital appreciation. Greenfield projects without guarantees of demand upon completion—e.g., variable electricity prices, uncertain traffic on roads and through ports—have a high weighting to capital appreciation.",,,Difficult,Conceptual,,2

Timberland tracts typically consist of thousands (or more) of acres of land, while farmland is quite frequently owned in smaller tracts of tens or hundreds of acres. As such, farmland is much more suited to family ownership, while timberland is more commonly owned by institutions.

Under both PoW and PoS consensus protocols, the validation of the transactions, or “mining,” always comes with rewards. A successful miner that validates the transactions obtains new digital assets—either a cryptocurrency or a token.

Asset-backed tokens can increase liquidity by allowing for fractional ownership of high-priced assets, such as houses, art, precious metals, and precious stones, which allows multiple investors to possess a fractional interest of the same asset.

Decentralized exchanges operate on a distributed platform without central coordination or control. The benefit is that should one of the computers on the network be attacked, the exchange remains operational since there are numerous other computers that continue to operate on the network. For this reason, decentralized exchanges are substantially more difficult to hack, rendering such attacks almost certain to fail. However, transactions on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are hosted on private servers, exposing the centralized exchanges and their clients to security vulnerabilities.

Investing in a cryptocurrency coin trust that holds Bitcoins is the best way to replicate the return on Bitcoins. Investing in a listed cryptocurrency exchange stock provides very indirect exposure that may not necessarily replicate the performance of Bitcoins because of a variety of company-specific factors, as well as the sensitivity to the general stock market environment.

A Baywhite client has entered into a long six-month MXN/USD FX forward contract—that is, an agreement to sell MXN and buy USD. The MXN/USD spot exchange rate at inception is 19.8248 (MXN19.8248 = USD1), the six-month MXN risk-free rate is 4.25%, and the six-month USD risk-free rate is 0.5%. Baywhite’s market strategist predicts that the Mexican central bank (Banco de Mexico) will surprise the market with a 50 bp short-term rate cut at its upcoming meeting. Which of the following statements best describes how the client’s existing FX forward contract will be impacted if this prediction is realized and other parameters remain unchanged?",The lower interest rate differential between MXN and USD will cause the MXN/USD contract forward rate to be adjusted downward.,The client will realize an MTM gain on the FX forward contract due to the decline in the MXN versus USD interest rate differential.,The lower interest rate differential between MXN and USD will cause the client to realize an MTM loss on the MXN/USD forward contract.,C,"C is correct. A decline in the interest rate differential between MXN and USD will cause the client to realize an MTM loss on the MXN/USD forward contract, while B states that this decline will result in an MTM gain. A is incorrect as the forward price, F0(T), is not adjusted during the contract life. 

Specifically, the original MXN/USD forward exchange rate at inception is equal to 20.20 (= 19.8248e^(.0425 – 0.005) × 0.5). If the MXN rate were to decline by 50 bps immediately after the contract is agreed, a new MXN/USD forward contract would be at a forward exchange rate of 20.15 [= 19.8248e^((.0375 – 0.005) × 0.5)]. The MXN would weaken or depreciate against the USD. Since the MXN seller has locked in a forward sale at the original 20.20 versus the new 20.15 rate, the seller’s MTM loss is equal to 0.05, or MXN50,000 per MXN1,000,000 (= 0.05 × 1,000,000) notional amount.",,,Difficult,Conceptual,D,2

5,7,68,Q2923,"Brian Jordan is interviewing for a junior equity analyst position at Orion Investment Advisors. As part of the interview process, Mary Benn, Orion’s Director of Research, provides Jordan with information about two hypothetical companies, Alpha and Beta, and asks him to comment on the companies’ financial statements and ratios. Both companies prepare their financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and are identical in all respects except for their accounting choices.

Jordan is told that, at the beginning of the current fiscal year, both companies purchased a major new computer system and began building new manufacturing plants for their own use. Alpha capitalized and Beta expensed the cost of the computer system; Alpha capitalized and Beta expensed the interest costs associated with the construction of the manufacturing plants.

Benn asks Jordan, “What was the impact of these decisions on each company’s current fiscal year financial statements and ratios?”

Jordan responds, “Alpha’s decision to capitalize the cost of its new computer system instead of expensing it results in lower net income, lower total assets, and higher cash flow from operating activities in the current fiscal year. Alpha’s decision to capitalize its interest costs instead of expensing them results in a lower fixed asset turnover ratio and a higher interest coverage ratio.”

Jordan is told that Alpha uses the straight-line depreciation method and Beta uses an accelerated depreciation method; both companies estimate the same useful lives for long-lived assets. Many companies in their industry use the units-of-production method.

Benn asks Jordan, “What are the financial statement implications of each depreciation method, and how do you determine a company’s need to reinvest in its productive capacity?”

Jordan replies, “All other things being equal, the straight-line depreciation method results in the least variability of net profit margin over time, while an accelerated depreciation method results in a declining trend in net profit margin over time. The units-of-production can result in a net profit margin trend that is quite variable. I use a three-step approach to estimate a company’s need to reinvest in its productive capacity. First, I estimate the average age of the assets by dividing net property, plant, and equipment by annual depreciation expense. Second, I estimate the average remaining useful life of the assets by dividing accumulated depreciation by depreciation expense. Third, I add the estimates of the average remaining useful life and the average age of the assets in order to determine the total useful life.”

Jordan is told that at the end of the current fiscal year, Alpha revalued a manufacturing plant; this increased its reported carrying amount by 15 percent. There was no previous downward revaluation of the plant. Beta recorded an impairment loss on a manufacturing plant; this reduced its carrying value by 10 percent.

Benn asks Jordan “What was the impact of these decisions on each company’s current fiscal year financial ratios?”

Jordan responds, “Beta’s impairment loss increases its debt to total assets and fixed asset turnover ratios, and lowers its cash flow from operating activities. Alpha’s revaluation increases its debt to capital and return on assets ratios, and reduces its return on equity.”

Jordan’s response about his approach to estimating a company’s need to reinvest in its productive capacity is most likely correct regarding estimating the:

",average age of the asset base.,total useful life of the asset base.,average remaining useful life of the asset base.,B,"B is correct. The estimated average total useful life of a company’s assets is calculated by adding the estimates of the average remaining useful life and the average age of the assets.

Jordan replies, “All other things being equal, the straight-line depreciation method results in the least variability of net profit margin over time, while an accelerated depreciation method results in a declining trend in net profit margin over time. The units-of-production can result in a net profit margin trend that is quite variable. I use a three-step approach to estimate a company’s need to reinvest in its productive capacity. First, I estimate the average age of the assets by dividing net property, plant, and equipment by annual depreciation expense. Second, I estimate the average remaining useful life of the assets by dividing accumulated depreciation by depreciation expense. Third, I add the estimates of the average remaining useful life and the average age of the assets in order to determine the total useful life.”

Jordan is told that at the end of the current fiscal year, Alpha revalued a manufacturing plant; this increased its reported carrying amount by 15 percent. There was no previous downward revaluation of the plant. Beta recorded an impairment loss on a manufacturing plant; this reduced its carrying value by 10 percent.

Benn asks Jordan “What was the impact of these decisions on each company’s current fiscal year financial ratios?”

Jordan responds, “Beta’s impairment loss increases its debt to total assets and fixed asset turnover ratios, and lowers its cash flow from operating activities. Alpha’s revaluation increases its debt to capital and return on assets ratios, and reduces its return on equity.”

Jordan’s response about the effect of Beta’s impairment loss is incorrect with respect to the impact on its:",Debt to total assets,fixed asset turnover,cash flow from operating activities.,C,"C is correct. The impairment loss is a non-cash charge and will not affect cash flow from operating activities.

5,7,74,Q2925,"Brian Jordan is interviewing for a junior equity analyst position at Orion Investment Advisors. As part of the interview process, Mary Benn, Orion’s Director of Research, provides Jordan with information about two hypothetical companies, Alpha and Beta, and asks him to comment on the companies’ financial statements and ratios. Both companies prepare their financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and are identical in all respects except for their accounting choices.

Jordan is told that, at the beginning of the current fiscal year, both companies purchased a major new computer system and began building new manufacturing plants for their own use. Alpha capitalized and Beta expensed the cost of the computer system; Alpha capitalized and Beta expensed the interest costs associated with the construction of the manufacturing plants.

Benn asks Jordan, “What was the impact of these decisions on each company’s current fiscal year financial statements and ratios?”

Jordan responds, “Alpha’s decision to capitalize the cost of its new computer system instead of expensing it results in lower net income, lower total assets, and higher cash flow from operating activities in the current fiscal year. Alpha’s decision to capitalize its interest costs instead of expensing them results in a lower fixed asset turnover ratio and a higher interest coverage ratio.”

Jordan is told that Alpha uses the straight-line depreciation method and Beta uses an accelerated depreciation method; both companies estimate the same useful lives for long-lived assets. Many companies in their industry use the units-of-production method.

Benn asks Jordan, “What are the financial statement implications of each depreciation method, and how do you determine a company’s need to reinvest in its productive capacity?”

Jordan’s response about the effect of Alpha’s revaluation is most likely correct with respect to the impact on its:",return on equity,return on assets,debt to capital ratio,A,"A is correct. In an asset revaluation, the carrying amount of the assets increases. The increase in the asset’s carrying amount bypasses the income statement and is reported as other comprehensive income and appears in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus.
